<center><h2><mark> Lesson 2: Internet Browser<L
/mark>  </h2></center>

<h4> <p style="color:red;"> Identifying Internet Browser </h4>

<p style="color:beige;">An internet browser, also known as a web browser or simply a 
browser, is a software program that lets you view web pages on your 
computer.
The main purpose of an internet browser is to translate the code that 
computers use to create websites into the text, graphics, and other 
features of the web pages that we're used to seeing today.
</p>

<p style="color:beige;>" Web browsers were first introduced in 1990, but they've evolved 
significantly since then.
</p>

<h4>  <p style="color:red;">The First Web Browser </h4>

<p style=color:beige;"> The first web browser was called World Wide Web; later, it 
changed its name to Nexus. Created by Sir Tim Berners-Lee, it gave 
people a basic way to view web pages. However, it was a long way from 
the immersive online experience we have today. </p>

<p style="color:beige;"> Without graphical browsers, the internet as we know it today 
would not be possible. In the 90s, the internet was text-based, bland, 
and couldn't be used without some fairly significant technical 
knowledge. This limited the number of people who had the interest and 
the ability to use the internet.
</p>

<p style="color:beige;"> The Mosaic browser helped make the internet ubiquitous. The 
graphical interface made navigating the web easy to understand and 
the ability to display graphics on websites made web pages more 
interesting. Best of all, people no longer needed to be programmers 
to enjoy themselves online.
</p>

  <h4> <p style="color:red;"> Modern Internet Browser </h4>

<p style="color:beige;">Modern internet browsers have many helpful features. Tabbed 
browsing, for example, lets you open up many web pages in individual 
tabs, instead of needing a resource-intensive separate window for 
each page. This is very helpful if you want to enter sweepstakes 
faster. Modern browsers offer security features, embedded video, 
nigh-instant loading times, and many other things that make the net 
such a fun place to spend time.</p>

  <h4><p style="color:red;">   How does the World Wide Web work? </h4>

<p style="color:beige;">Paving the way for an internet revolution that has transformed the 
world in only three decades, the World Wide Web consists of multiple 
components that enable users to access various resources, documents and web 
pages on the internet. Thus, the WWW is like a vast electronic book whose 
pages are stored or hosted on different servers worldwide.</p>

<p style="color:beige;">These pages are the primary component or building blocks of the WWW 
and are linked through hyperlinks, which provide access from one specific 
spot in a hypertext or hypermedia document to another spot within that 
document or a different one. Hyperlinks are another defining concept of the 
WWW and provide its identity as a collection of interconnected documents. </p>
  
  <center><h2><mark>Lesson 3: Introduction to Ethical Business Research</mark> </h2></center>
  
  <p style="color:red;"> 1.Integrity and Honesty</p>
  <p style="color:beige;">Upholding truthfulness and honesty in all aspects of the research process.
Avoiding manipulation or distortion of data to serve personal or organizational interests. <br/>
  <p style="color:red;">2.Respect for Participants<br/>
  <p style="color:beige;"> Ensuring the well-being, autonomy, and confidentiality of research participants.
Gaining informed consent before involving individuals or organizations in the study.<br/>
  <p style="color:red;">3.Transparency and Open Communication<br/>
  <p style="color:beige;" >Clearly communicating the research goals, methodologies, and potential impacts to all stakeholders <br/>
  <p style="color:red;">4.Build Trust and Credibility <br/>
  <p style="color:beige;">Foster trust among stakeholders by conducting research ethically and transparently.
Enhance the credibility of the research findings and recommendations.<br/>
  <p style="color:red;">  Contribute Positively to Society<br/>
  <p style="color:beige;" >Align research objectives with societal values and contribute positively to economic, social, and environmental sustainability.<br/>
    <p style="color:red;">6.Ethical Dissemination of Findings<br/>
  <p style="color:beige;"> Share research findings responsibly, ensuring accurate representation without sensationalism.<br/>
  
  <center><h2><mark>Lesson 4: Data and Customer Rights</mark></h2></center>
  
  <p style="color:beige;" >Data refers to raw facts, figures, or information typically stored and 
processed by computer systems. It can encompass a wide range of types, 
including text, numbers, images, audio, video, and more. In the context of 
modern technology and digital systems, data is often collected, processed, 
and analyzed to derive insights, make decisions, or perform various tasks.</p>
  <p style="color:beige;" >Customer rights, on the other hand, refer to the entitlements and 
protections afforded to individuals or entities who engage in transactions 
or relationships with businesses or organizations. These rights are 
established to ensure fair treatment, privacy, and security for customers 
in various interactions, particularly in the context of commerce and 
services. </p>
  
  <h4> <p style="color:red;">Personal Data</h4>
    
  <p style="color:beige;">Personal data refers to any information that relates to an identified 
or identifiable individual. This can include direct identifiers (such as a 
person's name, address, email, phone number, or social security number) as 
well as indirect identifiers (such as IP addresses, device IDs, or location 
data) that can be used to identify or distinguish a person's identity.</p>
  
  <p style="color:beige;">Personal data can be collected, processed, and stored by various 
entities, including businesses, government agencies, and online service 
providers. It's important to handle personal data responsibly and in 
accordance with applicable data protection laws and regulations, such as 
the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) in the European Union or the 
California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA) in the United States. These laws 
often require organizations to obtain explicit consent before collecting 
personal data, to inform individuals about how their data will be used, and 
to implement measures to protect the security and privacy of personal data. 
Violations of these laws can result in significant penalties and 
reputational damage for organizations.</p>
 
<h4><p style="color:red;">Europian Union</h4>
 <p style="color:beige;">The history of the European Union (EU) has been marked by periods of 
rapid change followed by periods of uncertainty: 
European integration has been an unpredictable process.</p>
 
 <h4><p style="color:red;">Origins</h4>
<p style="color:beige;">The European project was an attempt to overcome the nationalist 
conflicts of the first half of the twentieth century, especially the rivalry 
between Germany and France that had contributed to both world wars. After
1945, there was a strong will to ensure that war between Germany and France 
could never again occur. This led to a series of schemes that culminated in 
the establishment of the European Economic Community (EEC) in 1957, which 
eventually became the EU. Led in the early 1950s by Frenchmen Robert Schuman 
and Jean Monnet, the initial plan was for a European Coal and Steel Community 
(ECSC) that would make France, Germany, Italy, the Netherlands, Belgium and 
Luxembourg co-operate by forcing them to share their coal and steel resources 
in the post-war rebuilding of western Europe. This created the 
organizational model of a Commission, Council and Parliament that was 
adopted by the EEC.</p>
   
<h4><p style="color:red;"> Founding the EU</h4>
<p style="color:beige;">The EEC was established under the Treaty of Rome in 1957. Primarily, 
the EEC aimed to extend the principle behind the ECSC to other areas of 
trade by creating a customs union. However, it also had more political 
ambitions for European integration – described at the start of the treaty 
as creating ‘an ever-closer union between the peoples of Europe. </p>
 <p style="color:beige;">Yet this mixture of economic and political union was not the only 
option open to European countries in the 1950s. Britain, Switzerland, 
Austria and the Scandinavian countries were at this time engaged in the 
European Free Trade Area (EFTA): a looser organization based on a zone of 
free trade without an external tariff barrier.</p>
 <p style="color:beige;">The early years of the EEC were principally focused upon developing 
the customs union. During this period, a huge economic boom, led by a dynamic 
West Germany, created much greater prosperity in western Europe and drove 
forward the liberalization of the EEC economy. </p>
<p style="color:beige;"> In 1963, Britain made its first attempt to join but was rebuffed by the French President Charles De 
Gaulle. De Gaulle dominated the European Community in the 1960s, fueling 
conflict between those who wanted to push forward a political union and 
those, like himself, who wanted to maintain their national identities. </p>
<p style="color:beige;">By the 1970s, when Britain, Ireland and Denmark finally joined the 
EEC, the project had slowed down considerably. Although the 1970s saw the 
first proposals for monetary union, the EEC of nine states found it more 
difficult to reach agreement than the original six had.</p>
    
 <h4> <p style="color:red;"> Faster Integration </h4>
    
<p style="color:beige;"> It was not until the mid-1980s - when Spain, Greece and Portugal joined 
that the pace of European integration really picked up again with the 
agreement of the Single European Act (1986). This laid down a timetable for 
the completion of the single market while looking towards creating monetary 
union and driving forward the agenda for political union.</p>
 <p style="color:beige;">The 1989 fall of the Berlin Wall and the reunification of Germany in 
1990 provided a huge boost to this process. In 1992, the Maastricht Treaty 
transformed the European Community – turning it into the EU, giving it new 
roles in the areas of foreign and domestic policy, and setting a timetable 
for the creation of the Euro. Subsequently, the treaties of Amsterdam (1997) 
and Nice (2001) expanded these powers.</p>
<p style="color:beige;">The EU today A Treaty establishing a Constitution for Europe, drafted 
in 2004, was rejected by referendums in France and the Netherlands in 2005. 
The ‘constitutional project’ was then revived in the form of the Lisbon 
Treaty, which was signed by the leaders of EU nations in 2007. The treaty 
was hugely controversial because it was very similar to the failed 
constitution. The treaty was rejected by Ireland in a referendum in 2008, 
however Ireland eventually ratified the treaty following a second referendum 
in October 2009. The Lisbon Treaty finally came into force in December 2009. </p>

<h4><p style="color:red;">Future of Customer Rights</h4>

 <p  style="color:beige;">Consumer rights can be defined as the right to safety, the right to 
be informed, the right to choose, and the right to be heard. These rights 
were meant to ensure consumers' fair treatment and that they had the 
information they needed to make informed decisions about the products and 
services they bought.</p>
  
  <h4><p style="color:red;">The basic rights of customers</h4>
  <p style="color:beige;" >The eight consumer rights are: Right to basic needs, right to safety, 
Right to information, Right to choose, Right to representation, Right to 
redress, Right to consumer education, and Right to healthy environment. </p>

  <h4> <p style="color:red;">What is RA 7394 in the Philippines</h4>
  <p style="color:beige;"> This act shall be known as the "Consumer Act of the Philippines". -
ARTICLE 2. Declaration of Basic Policy. It is the policy of the State to 
protect the interest of the consumer, promote his general welfare and to 
establish standards of conduct for business and industry.</p>
 
  <p style="color:beige;"> Overall, the future of customer data rights will be characterized by 
a heightened focus on privacy, transparency, empowerment, and 
accountability, driven by advancements in technology, changing consumer 
expectations, and evolving regulatory landscapes. Businesses that prioritize 
and respect customer data rights will not only comply with legal requirements 
but also build trust and loyalty with their customers in an increasingly 
data-driven world.</p>
